# LAB | Java Basics

<!-- Labs are mandatory and must be completed before the end of the next week.

You make work collaboratively with your classmates, but you may not copy and paste another student's code. -->

## Instructions

<!-- - Create a new GitHub repository named `Enterprise-Java-Development-1.01`
- Upload the code for all of the following prompts to your repository.
- Submit a URL link to your repository below. -->

1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Solve the challenges.

## Deliverables

- Upon completion, add your solution to git.
- Then commit to git and push to your repo on GitHub.
- Make a pull request and paste the pull request link in the submission field in the Student Portal.

## Tasks

1. Write a method in Java to get the difference between the largest and smallest values in an array of integers. The length of the array must be **1 and above**. Use loops and conditionals to develop the algorithm.
2. Write a method in Java to find the smallest and second smallest elements of a given array and print it in the console. Use loops and conditionals to develop the algorithm.
3. Create an `Employee` class to represent an employee of a company. Add all relevant properties and behaviors that you might need but you have to include a `salary` property. Don't forget to add getters and setters.
4. Create an `Intern` class that extends from `Employee`. All the Interns have a salary limit of 20000 (constant). You must validate if an intern is created (or salary updated) with a bigger salary than the max. The max value is set.
5. Write a program that creates 10 Employees and print it al the properties.
